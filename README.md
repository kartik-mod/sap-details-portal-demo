# SAP Portal - StackBlitz Ready Project

This is a Vite + React + Tailwind project pre-populated with a mock SAP Portal-style frontend.
It runs entirely in the browser (StackBlitz / CodeSandbox) or locally.

How to run in StackBlitz:
1. Go to https://stackblitz.com
2. Create a new project and choose *Import from ZIP*
3. Upload the ZIP file in this package
4. Install dependencies (StackBlitz typically does this automatically)
5. Open the preview â€” the app runs instantly.

How to run locally:
1. unzip
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Note: This project uses mock metadata and is frontend-only.
